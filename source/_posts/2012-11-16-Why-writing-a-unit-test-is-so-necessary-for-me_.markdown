The simplest answer to this question is that I am too lazy.<br /><br />The more, I'm always doing refactoring until I can't tough them. But it's obvious that I don't want to test the code again and again, not to mention testing manually. So unit testing is great to keep me safe that I wouldn't crash the whole system after refactoring.
