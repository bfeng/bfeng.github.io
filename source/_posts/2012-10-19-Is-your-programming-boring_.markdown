1. Programming is Boring

	Boring is a feeling when people is suffering the same things again and again. But my question is how programming could be the same things, in that case programmers should make that specific program reusable, for instance making that kind of program into a shared library.<br />Programming is a kind of creation consuming work, in the way of not only the working style programmer could enjoy but also the coding style in a specific program. Actually, programmers in most companies are allowed to choose computers they like to work on, and while coding, programmers could also improve their programs' algorithms. Thus, programming may not be felt so boring.

2. You Spend Most of Your Working Life in Front of a Computer Screen

	Computers did change the life styles of people as TV did long times ago. Even if people is not working on programming such as an officer from bank, they still work in front of a computer screen every business day.

3. You Have to Work Long Hours

	Every job in the real world needs to work long hours.

4. Programming is Asocial

	Programmers are regarded as geeks, but sometimes as nerds. However, using asocial to describe them is unreasonable. From my experience, programmers are likely lack of the capability of socialization as others, even some of them are not easily to communicate with. But considering the programming characteristics, they are actually lack of the possibility of directly contact with people.

5. Programming is Only for Those Who Think Logically

	Logic gets a high level for programming, because programs themselves are organized and running logically. But programming is now involved a large range of things, in which not only logic but also creative thinking as used in painting, music and dancing.

6. Software is Being Outsourced

	This may be the topic especially for Americans. But anyway, even if we have international cooperation of programming, understanding how to programming and mastering the skills is still indispensable. This is not only because software sometimes involves security problems but also because design and analysis of software is highly related to programming.

7. Programming is a Well-Paid Profession

	It is on some average well-paid. Considering the underlying working to become a proficient programmer and the value he/she contributed, this kind of job is paid evenly.
