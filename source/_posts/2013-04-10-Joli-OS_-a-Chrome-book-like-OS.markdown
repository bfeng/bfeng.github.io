For a long time, I really envy those who have Chrome book, whose OS is not a normal Linux distribution (of course), but a browser based OS. Chrome OS is a cool way to use computers. However if you want to try it, you can try install it on a virtual machine or if you don't care about money you can buy one.

But if you just want to taste a Chromebook-like experience, worn out of trying it in a virtual machine and don't want to waste money to buy a real one and the most is that you happened to have an old laptop like mine (the one I'm typing on), you can try to install Joli OS.
