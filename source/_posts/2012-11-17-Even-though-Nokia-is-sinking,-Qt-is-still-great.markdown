Today I watched a video of porting Qt application into Android. It looks so fantastic that more and more platforms are emerging, iPhone, Android, Windows, and some others flying on netbooks with touch&nbsp;capabilities. Let's call them smart mobile devices.<br /><br />The typical problem developers are being solving is to make an application and port it to more available platforms. However, porting is so&nbsp;frustrated to programmers because it is like a progress of copying yourself. In contrast, DRY (don't copy yourself) is the first principle of programming.<br /><br />Other technologies which can help to do porting seems great. At least this one looks so.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://1.gvt0.com/vi/suPeZ7XC1xk/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/suPeZ7XC1xk&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/suPeZ7XC1xk&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br />
